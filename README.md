### IMDB Reviews Classification Model

This project implements a basic Tensorflow model to moview reviews. The possible categories are possitive and negative reviews. 

### Instructions:

Simply run the main.py file and wait till it returns a zero code. The script downloads a dataset, preprocess it and then uses it to train a neural network model. Once that is ready, it saves the model in H5 format and the training results on a logs folder. The logs folder can be accessed using the tensorboard UI.

### Env Requirements:

Python 3.9\
Use pip install -r ./requirements.txt
